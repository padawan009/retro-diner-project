        <!-- <p>My name is Tommy Grace, and I’m the proud owner of Retro Diner Restaurant, 
            a retro spot located right in the heart of New York City at 1231 Main Street Building. 
            Like much of this city, my story is one of dreams, challenges, and perseverance.</p>
        <p>I was born in Brooklyn in 1946, the son of a factory worker. As a kid, I loved tagging along with my dad to a small diner down the street. 
            It had a long chrome bar, spinning stools, and the mouthwatering smell of fresh burgers. 
            Even then, I noticed how the place brought people together: taxi drivers, office workers, young couples. 
            That diner was a little slice of New York’s warmth, and it stuck with me.</p>
        <p>Life moved on. There was the army, years working in construction, and raising a family. 
            But the dream of owning my own place never faded. In 2010, when I came across an old, abandoned building on Main Street, something clicked. 
            The space was in rough shape, but I saw its potential. I thought back to that diner from my childhood and decided: 
            Retro Diner Restaurant would be my way of preserving that piece of history.</p>
        <p>With my wife, Joan, by my side, we spent months transforming the space. 
            Red leather booths, shining chrome details, a vintage jukebox from the ’50s—it all came together piece by piece. 
            We kept the building’s original brickwork and added a glowing rocket sign outside, a tribute to chasing dreams.</p>
        <p>Today, every time I walk past the counter where someone’s enjoying a classic milkshake or a burger, I feel a sense of pride. 
            Retro Diner Restaurant has become a place where New York breathes nostalgia, and people find a moment of joy and connection amid the city’s chaos.</p> -->

            My dream began in the diners of 1940s Brooklyn, where I’d sit with my dad, mesmerized by the chrome counters, 
            spinning stools, and the way these places brought people together.</p>

            In 2010, I found an old, run-down building on Main Street and knew it was time. 
            With my wife, Joan, we restored it, adding red leather booths, gleaming chrome, and a vintage jukebox. 
            The glowing rocket sign outside became a symbol of my journey.</p>
