            <h2>our retro diner restaurant story</h2>
            <p>My name is Tommy Grace, and I own Retro Diner Restaurant, a retro gem at 1231 Main Street Building in New York City. 
            My dream began in the diners of 1940s Brooklyn, where I’d sit with my dad, mesmerized by the chrome counters, 
            spinning stools, and the way these places brought people together.</p>
            <p>Life took me through the army, construction work, and raising a family, but the dream never left me. 
            In 2010, I found an old, run-down building on Main Street and knew it was time. 
            With my wife, Joan, we restored it, adding red leather booths, gleaming chrome, and a vintage jukebox. 
            The glowing rocket sign outside became a symbol of my journey.</p>
            <p>Today, Retro Diner Restaurant is a haven of nostalgia where New Yorkers escape the hustle for a burger, milkshake,
                and a taste of the past. It’s my tribute to the city I love.</p>
